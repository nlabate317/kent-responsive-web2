                    dedicate myself to the Jr. Toddler class full time! I have a Bachelors degree in Music

                    worked with kids of all ages since I was one myself. I love working with children
                    because they're so honest, fun-loving and do and say the most outrageous things! I
                    find myself laughing a lot when I'm with them. I love to see them learn and grow as
